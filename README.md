## Trash Tracker: Navigating Urban Cleanliness

In the urban hustle, waste management is a silent choreographer, and "Trash Tracker" takes the lead in this environmental ballet. This project blends technology with a green agenda to redefine how we perceive and address waste in our cities.

### Surveillance Choreography:
Mounted on government or public vehicles, cameras become vigilant storytellers, capturing real-time city dynamics. Trash Tracker doesn't just record; it interprets, identifying waste-prone areas with precision.

### Image, Location, Intervention:
A seamless integration of captured images and GEO location data transforms urban waste into actionable intelligence. Each image tells a story, and Trash Tracker knows not just what it sees but precisely where the narrative unfolds â€“ crafting a map of urban cleanliness complexities.

### Alerts Orchestrating Change:
Trash Tracker conducts a symphony of alerts, ensuring timely cues for those entrusted with maintaining cleanliness. Waste is no longer an anonymous presence; it demands attention and action. Cleaning staff receives instant notifications, responding promptly to urgent garbage pickup needs.

### Community Spotlight:
Beyond technology, Trash Tracker is a stage for community participation. Residents actively engage, reporting areas that need attention and providing valuable feedback. Together, city dwellers and Trash Tracker compose a harmonious collaboration toward a cleaner, more sustainable urban future.
